# UpOrNot üåê  
**Monitor and analyze server uptime and health in real-time.**  

UpOrNot is a "lightweight" server monitoring tool built in Go that keeps track of the health of your servers by regularly pinging them, recording response times, and calculating uptime percentages. It includes a web interface to view server statuses and a RESTful API to integrate monitoring data into your own applications.

---

## Features ‚ú®
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously checks server availability using ICMP ping.
- **Detailed Metrics**: Tracks response times, uptime percentages, and the number of successful checks.
- **Web Interface**: Serve a static web page to visualize server statuses easily.
- **RESTful API**: Access server health data programmatically via JSON.
- **Concurrency**: Efficiently monitors multiple servers using a thread-safe approach.
- **Configurable**: Read server configurations from a YAML file for easy setup and modification.

---

## How It Works üöÄ
1. **Server Monitoring**: UpOrNot uses ICMP pings to determine server status and response times.
2. **Data Storage**: Metrics like uptime and checks are dynamically updated in memory.
3. **Web/API Access**: 
   - A web interface (`static/index.html`) is served to view server health.
   - An API endpoint (`/api/status`) provides server details in JSON format.
4. **Configurable Servers**: Define servers to monitor in a `service-list.yaml` file.

## Installation and Setup üõ†Ô∏è
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UpOrNot.git
   cd UpOrNot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
3. Create a `service-list.yaml` file in the root directory:
   ```yaml
   servers:
     - name: Google
       host: google.com
     - name: GitHub
       host: github.com
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080` to view the dashboard.

## API Usage üåê
**Endpoint**: `/api/status`  
**Method**: `GET`  
**Response**: JSON containing server statuses, uptime, and response times.  

Example:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Google",
    "host": "google.com",
    "status": true,
    "lastChecked": "2025-01-26T12:30:00Z",
    "responseTime": 23,
    "uptime": 99.9,
    "checks": 100,
    "successes": 99
  },
  {
    "name": "GitHub",
    "host": "github.com",
    "status": false,
    "lastChecked": "2025-01-26T12:29:58Z",
    "responseTime": 0,
    "uptime": 95.4,
    "checks": 100,
    "successes": 95
  }
]
```
